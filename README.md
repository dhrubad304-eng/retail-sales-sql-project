# Retail Sales & Warranty Analytics using SQL

### **Summary**
A complete SQL project analyzing product sales, store performance, warranties, and category trends using advanced SQL queries.

### **Overview**
This project demonstrates end-to-end SQL skills by building a structured retail database and performing meaningful business analytics.
It includes schema creation, EDA, complex analytical queries, window functions, and performance insights across products, stores, categories, and warranties.

### **Problem Statement**
Retail businesses often struggle to understand which products perform well, which stores generate the highest revenue, which categories face warranty issues, and how sales trends change over time.
This project solves these challenges by creating a relational database and analyzing patterns using SQL.

### **Dataset**
- The project uses multiple tables:
  - category – Product categories
  - products – Product details
  - stores – Store locations
  - sales – All sales transactions
  - warranty – Warranty claim records


### *Tools and Technologies*
- PostgreSQL 
- SQL (Joins, CTEs, Window Functions)
- GitHub

### **Methods** 
- Database Schema Design
  - PK–FK relations

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Counting records
  - Understanding structure
  - Basic descriptive checks

- Analytical SQL Techniques Used
  - Inner & Left Joins
  - Aggregations
  - Window functions (LAG, ROW_NUMBER, RANK)
  - Multiple CTEs
  - Revenue calculations
  - Year-over-year growth analysis
    
### **Key Insights**
- The SQL analysis answers questions like:
  - Which products generate the highest revenue?
  - Which stores perform best?
  - Which categories have the most warranty issues?
  - What is the average time gap between sale and warranty claim?
  - What is the YoY growth in sales?
  - Which top 3 categories earn the most revenue per store?
  - Which countries generate the most revenue from premium-priced products?
  - These insights provide real business value for decision-making.

### **Results & Conclusion**
- The analysis reveals:
  - Top products and categories driving revenue
  - Store performance variations by region
  - Warranty-heavy categories requiring product quality review
  - Sales trends over time including YoY growth
  - Valuable insights for strategic decision-making
  - This project demonstrates strong SQL capabilities across design, EDA, and analytics.
